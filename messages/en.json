    "description": "Hi, I'm Mehdi Ahmadi, a 24-year-old frontend developer with a lifelong passion for technology. My journey started as a kid, tinkering with my older brother's computer whenever I had the chance. Two years ago, I decided to pursue frontend development professionally, attending an institute while primarily being self-taught. I also gained a year of hands-on experience working as a frontend developer in a company. Now, I'm eager to join a professional team where I can continue learning and growing."
